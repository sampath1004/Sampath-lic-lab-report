# Experiment 4: Design and analysis of current mirror circuit

## Design question

Part A

i) design for gain>-10 V/V. Vdd = 1.8V, P <= 1mW

Design for the current mirror ratio 1:1 and 1:2 

ii) Analyze the circuit current mirror

iii) Case 1: Lmin = 180nm              W/L = x
             L = 500nm
             L = 1um

iv) Transient and AC analysis
